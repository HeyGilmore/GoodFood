# Good Food
This project is a dynamic restaurant homepage created using **Git**, **npm**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**, and **Webpack**. The goal is to practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering all website content using JavaScript. 

Styling is done via an external CSS file, while the structure and interactivity of the site are built entirely in JavaScript.


## Introduction

In this project, weâ€™ll:
- Dynamically generate the entire website using JavaScript.
- Practice modular JavaScript development and DOM manipulation.
- Use Webpack to bundle our JavaScript and assets.
- Deploy the project using GitHub Pages.
